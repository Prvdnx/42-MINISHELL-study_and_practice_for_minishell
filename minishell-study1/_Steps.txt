Step-by-step approach:


### Step 1: Project Setup

1. **Create Project Folder:**
   - Set up a new project folder for your minishell.

2. **Initialize Git:**
   - Initialize a Git repository for version control.

### Step 2: Basic Shell Structure

3. **Create Main Shell File:**
   - Write a simple C program with a loop to display a prompt and read user input.

4. **Read User Input:**
   - Use `readline` to read user input.

### Step 3: External Functions

5. **Implement External Functions:**
   - Implement basic versions of external functions needed for the project (e.g., `fork`, `execve`, `wait`, etc.).

### Step 4: Command Execution

6. **Search and Launch Executable:**
   - Implement logic to search and execute the correct executable based on user input.

7. **Process Creation:**
   - Use `fork` to create a new process.

8. **Execute Command:**
   - In the child process, use `execve` to execute the command.

9. **Wait for Child Process:**
   - In the parent process, use `wait` to wait for the child process to complete.

### Step 5: Quote Handling

10. **Handle Single and Double Quotes:**
    - Implement logic to handle single and double quotes in user input.

### Step 6: Redirections

11. **Implement Redirections:**
    - Implement logic to handle input and output redirection (<, >, <<, >>).

### Step 7: Pipes

12. **Implement Pipes:**
    - Implement logic to handle pipes (|).

### Step 8: Environment Variables

13. **Handle Environment Variables:**
    - Implement logic to expand environment variables (e.g., $PATH) in user input.

### Step 9: Exit Status and Signals

14. **Manage Exit Status:**
    - Implement logic to get the exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline ($?).

15. **Handle Signals:**
    - Implement signal handlers for ctrl-C, ctrl-D, and ctrl-\.

### Step 10: Builtins

16. **Implement Builtins:**
    - Create functions for each builtin command (echo, cd, pwd, export, unset, env, exit).

### Step 11: Memory Management

17. **Memory Allocation and Deallocation:**
    - Ensure proper memory allocation and deallocation in your code. Avoid memory leaks.

### Step 12: Testing

18. **Create Test Programs:**
    - Develop test programs to verify the correctness of your shell. Test various scenarios, including edge cases and error conditions.

### Step 13: Documentation

19. **Code Comments:**
    - Add comments to explain the logic and design choices in your code.

### Step 14: Norm Compliance

20. **Check Norm Rules:**
    - Regularly run norm checks to identify and fix any norm errors.

### Step 15: Submission

21. **Submit to Git Repository:**
    - Commit your changes and push your code to the assigned Git repository.

By breaking down the project into these steps, you can focus on implementing and testing one feature at a time. Remember to refer to the project requirements and test your shell thoroughly as you progress through each step. Good luck with your minishell project!
